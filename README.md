## How does Pomodoro Work? 
  
  To use the Pomodoro technique, you simply choose a task to work on, set a timer for 25 minutes, and work on the task until the timer goes off. Then, take a short break of 5-10 minutes before starting another Pomodoro. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.

## Why Pomodoro?

  The idea behind the technique is that by breaking work into shorter, focused intervals, people can avoid burnout and maintain their energy and motivation throughout the day. It also helps to create a sense of urgency and encourages people to eliminate distractions and focus on the task at hand during each Pomodoro.
